# AI Multi-Agent Platform

A general-purpose, self-hostable, model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic AI multi-agent platform.

The platform is designed around canonical tasks, runs, agents, tools, models, workers, nodes, artifacts and events. Concrete systems such as Hermes, Forge, LiteLLM, MCP-compatible tool servers, model runtimes, storage engines or workflow engines are integrations behind replaceable contracts rather than the definition of the platform itself.

## Core principles

- General purpose; not tied to ScoreSymphony or another application domain.
- Task-centric rather than chat-centric.
- Model/provider agnostic.
- Hardware/deployment agnostic.
- Single-node and distributed multi-node operation use the same conceptual model.
- Replaceable orchestration, execution, model, tool, memory, file, knowledge and authorization layers.
- API-first and plugin-friendly.
- Self-hostable and local-first.
- Baseline operation must not require recurring paid AI/API services.

## Architecture

The authoritative product direction lives in [`docs/PRODUCT_VISION.md`](docs/PRODUCT_VISION.md). Non-negotiable architectural boundaries live in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md).

## Development

A fresh-clone setup and the validation commands are documented in [`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md). Contribution and architecture-change rules live in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Repository-level integration boundaries are reserved under `adapters/`, `workers/` and `frontend/`; concrete contracts are intentionally deferred to the numbered architecture issues.

## Licensing and upstream components

Project-owned source is distributed under the MIT License in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). Rules for third-party source, dependencies, services, adapters, vendored/forked source, selective ports and reference-only influence live in [`LICENSE_POLICY.md`](LICENSE_POLICY.md).

Before approving an architecture-significant upstream, complete [`docs/UPSTREAM_ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/UPSTREAM_ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md). Approved/integrated upstream provenance is recorded in [`docs/UPSTREAMS.md`](docs/UPSTREAMS.md) using the machine-readable starting format in [`upstream/PROVENANCE_TEMPLATE.yaml`](upstream/PROVENANCE_TEMPLATE.yaml). Updates and periodic reviews follow [`docs/UPSTREAM_UPDATE_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/UPSTREAM_UPDATE_WORKFLOW.md).

The policy is exercised against multiple integration models in [`docs/UPSTREAM_POLICY_VALIDATION.md`](docs/UPSTREAM_POLICY_VALIDATION.md).

## Status

The repository is at its initial architecture/bootstrap stage. Implementation work should follow the numbered GitHub issues in order unless an explicit dependency decision changes that order.
